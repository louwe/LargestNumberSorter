# LargestNumberSorter
This program parses a text file for numbers.
The first valid number parsed will be designated as N.
A list is then created in ascending order.
The master branch will generate a list that may hold duplicates.
The branch 'f/DistinctLargestNumberSorter' only stores distinct numbers and may not contain duplicates.
